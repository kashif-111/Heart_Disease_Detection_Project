# Heart_Disease_Detection_Project
Heart disease prediction involves using medical data—such as age, BP, cholesterol levels, lifestyle habits, and test results—to estimate a person’s risk of developing heart-related conditions. Machine learning models analyze patterns in this data to help identify high-risk individuals early, enabling timely diagnosis and preventive treatment

 Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. By analyzing key health indicators such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and lifestyle factors, the model helps identify individuals who may be at risk. Early prediction can support timely diagnosis and preventive healthcare decisions.

 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

User-friendly prediction interface (CLI, script, or web app depending on your setup)
